- SOLVED: there is a bug in javafx where menu items stay focused after unhover
- SOLVED: currently, deleting an item only modifies the stored list in the respective ui class,
needs to actually modify data in algorithm.Algorithm.data
- SOLVED: importing data for display.GradesDisplay is currently hard coded, link it to the import button in
its parent class (this file)
- SOLVED (gonna call this intentional): you can currently import a file multiple times, and it duplicates data, decide if this should happen
- DONE: add way to cycle through multiple different schedules
- DONE: remove debug print statements
- DONE: prompt user to save data before exiting if they changed something
and if it should clear data fields
- DONE: the text when the table is empty is black. Make it white

- add way to move classes around in the view menu. The menu should be able to highlight red
if its an invalid position and green if its valid

HIGH PRIORITY:
- add way to remove constraint

- FIXED: clicking on view before there is data breaks the algorithm. It no longer functions
- FIXED: there is a bug where if you click on constraints and go to view. it shows as blank. Only happens if there is more than
one item in the generatedSchedules list which might be a hint
- FIXED (i think): bug where if you click on view, then go to constraints, then go to view it shows the save button at the top
- DONE: make constraints. It should be an empty grid of (periods x grades) and the user should be able to click on a box
to set the class that should be there
- FIXED: going from view to constraints duplicates the save button and the arrows
- DONE: Make previous button work, only the next button works right now
- FIXED: updating the data and then going to the algorithm to check doesnt actually force the algorithm to run again
- FIXED: clicking view and then loading data, then clicking view again causes the program to display nothing in the
subject slots. The grades and periods are correctly displayed though
- DONE: when the application is started, it shows "initial content", it should display the import/export section instead
- DONE: add information about class when you hover over it in the view menu
- DONE: add way to save schedule to a pdf or json or something
- DONE: add ability to export data once modified
- DONE: make a data clear button in the data screen. It should ask for confirmation before deleting everything
- (it fixed itself maybe? idk, cant reproduce) for some reason when using 3 periods and 3 grades and only one class,
the class is assigned to two different periods
- DONE: clicking view after leaving causes the program to calculate the next possibility. dont do this

LOW PRIORITY:
- Add a info box at the top of the view menu recommending using constraints if theyre looking for something specific
- when sorting grades it only sort based on the first digit (10 comes before 9 etc.) (this is annoying to fix and
likely wont be noticed by user so its low priority)
- if there is not data to make a schedule with, do not display the arrows and save button
- currently it displays all grades through the range. So if you input grade 1 and grade 10, but not 1-10, it will
still try to display 1-10.
- make the save button for a schedule only save the top rows and exclude the bottom row which has the arrows and the
save button
- make sure you cant spam click the next button, it sometimes crashes the program
- sometimes the program just stalls if you try to cycle to next schedule. Make a way to stop and retry?
- add way to see which schedule you're on
